      <br><p>On this very important mission you (Rousseau) are on a mission to stop whats happening at the white house, but also the corrupt</p>
      <br><p>society is trying to stop you. You will become the hero to stop the violence and then people will see you as a hero. Once they see this,</p>
      <br><p>you had an idea of running president and hopefully the people will support you through your ideas of social contract, letting everyone know</p>
      <br><p>your intention of freedom and indepedence for everyone. Not just that but to stop global warming and to keep the earth clean. You also announce</p>
      <br><p>a society where there will be no chains latched onto their arms anymore, where there will be a social contract but freedom aswell!</p>
